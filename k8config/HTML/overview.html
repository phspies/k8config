    <p>Configurator Toolkit for Kubernetes Fling is a commandline-based tool for authoring Kubernetes YAML files and performing basic Kubernetes administration tasks. Written in .Net 5.0, the tool enables cross platform use on Windows, OSX and Linux.</p>
    <p>The tool enables two main features which can be devided into two categories:
        <ul>
            <li>
                YAML Functionality
                <ul>
                    <li>YAML definition by means of a structured folder based approach.</li>
                    <li>Import/Export YAML constructs with support for multiple YAML definitions in a single file.</li>
                    <li>Realtime attribute type checking to ensure values entered matches the required Kubernetes API types.</li>
                    <li>Interactivly create/edit/delete any attribute within the defined YAML construct.</li>
                    <li>Verify YAML definition based on the Kubernetes API.</li>
                    <li>Realtime access to API attribute documentation which is based on the Kubernetes API.</li>
                    <li>Realtime view of the current Kubernetes defined service.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                Realtime Management Functionality
                <ul>
                    <li>Easy connection access to already defined kubectl constructs as defined by the "kubectl" command.</li>
                    <li>Additional connectivity options via a proxy API session.</li>
                    <li>Track changes to namespaces, pods, deployment, replication sets and services in realtime mode.</li>
                    <li>Report of changes to namespaces, pods, deployment, replication sets and services by means of Kubernetes events.</li>
                    <li>Edit or apply any current of new Kubernetes definition construct with access to object configuration information and logs</li>
                    <li>Execute commands to pods with access to output of these commands for troubleshooting</li>
                </ul>
